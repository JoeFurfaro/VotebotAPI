# VotebotAPI
A project created to generalize the solution of the ECCCVoteBot into an open-source using a RESTful API. The idea is to allow users to create events where they can invite their user base to come vote. They can also prepare templates of events and start an event at any time, spinning up a server that their users can join and participate in.
